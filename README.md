# 🌸 Iris Dataset KNN Project

## 📅 Date
2/9/2025  

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the **Iris dataset** to apply the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification.  
The Iris dataset contains **150 samples of iris flowers** from 3 species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) with 4 features each:  
- Sepal Length (cm)  
- Sepal Width (cm)  
- Petal Length (cm)  
- Petal Width (cm)  

The goal is to classify iris flowers based on these features.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Import Libraries** – pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.  
2. **Upload Dataset** – Loaded `Iris.csv` into Google Colab.  
3. **Inspect Data** – Displayed first 5 rows to check structure.  
4. **Visualizations** – Created pairplots and histograms to explore patterns.  
5. **Prepare Features and Labels** – Split data into features (X) and labels (y).  
6. **Split Dataset** – 80% training and 20% testing.  
7. **Build KNN Model** – Used k=3 neighbors.  
8. **Train the Model** – Fitted the model on training data.  
9. **Make Predictions** – Predicted species on test data.  
10. **Evaluate Model** – Measured accuracy score of the predictions.

## 📊 Visualizations
- Pairplot of all features colored by species.  
- Histograms of each feature.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the project in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Upload the `Iris.csv` dataset.  
3. Run the notebook cells step by step.  
4. Visualizations and model results will be displayed directly.

## ✅ Results
The KNN model achieved a strong accuracy in classifying the iris species, showing that simple machine learning algorithms can be very effective on well-structured datasets.
